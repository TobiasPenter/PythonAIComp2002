Contains the code for my AI module in my second year of university.

The first section is analysing what model is best for predicting which health insurance suits a person and the second part is about what optimisation technique is best when using a hill climber.

This code is best run in Jupyter Notebook as there are graphs that are to be displayed as well as analysis of each model or optimisation technique in markdown that may not be readable in another code environment.
